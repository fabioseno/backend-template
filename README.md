# backend-template
An experimental project that combines NestJS, NestJS monorepos, AWS services and Clean Architecture in a proper clear structure.

## NestJS monorepo
Nest structures the repo using **workspaces**. Each workspace organizes projects into applications (piece of code you can run and deploy) and libraries (Nest components that can be composed into applications in order to run).
